#  Load indicator for macOS

Some time ago I've just searched for a CPU meter which is free and usable... Unfortunately I havent found, so I've decided to write my own :)

This is really a pre-alpha phase but working, showing correct values, and not eating the CPU.. The app just olny uses 16Mb of RAM

If you like it, star it and leave some feedback, change request, bugz, and I'll fix that, implement that.

Thanks for visiting!
